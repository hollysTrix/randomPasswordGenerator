Ever get sick and tired of having to think up new passwords or find it too dangerous to use the same password for everything, but don't trust online password generators?

Well, today is your lucky day!

Just run this code, tell it how many characters you need and it'll do all the hard work for you.
All you need to do is save the password to your google/firefox browser and hey presto! Just like magic (or maybe I'm just lazy).
